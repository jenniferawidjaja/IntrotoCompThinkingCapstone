Introduction to Computational Thinking Data Science: Capstone Project

Project Milestone I
Investigating the Influence of Age on Consumer Purchasing Behavior

For this capstone project, we intend on conducting a data visualization which investigates the
influence of age on consumer purchasing behavior. In this study, we will leverage the
“Customer Shopping Trends Dataset” from Kaggle which contains information on customer’s
age, purchase history, and various transaction details. The primary objective of this project
would be to identify how brands can leverage marketing strategies and product offerings to
incentivize younger consumers to purchase their projects.

Our project objectives are to,
1. Age Distribution Analysis: The first step in our project will involve analyzing the
distribution of customer ages within the dataset. This will provide a foundational
understanding of the age demographics of the customer base.
2. Age and Purchasing Behavior: We intend to investigate whether distinct age groups
within our customer base exhibit disparate purchasing behaviors. This investigation will
delve into variables such as purchase amount, product category preferences, and the
frequency of purchases.
3. Some of the questions we are thinking of analyzing:
(a) Is there a significant correlation between one’s age and their purchasing habits?
(b) What is the biggest shopping factor that influences different age groups’
purchasing behavior?
(c) How does seasonal products influence younger audiences to purchase
products?

In this project, we plan to leverage data visualization as a powerful means to communicate our
findings. Visualizations will range from histograms, scatterplots, bar charts, and potentially even
interactive dashboards. These visual representations of data will allow for a more accessible
and engaging interpretation of the insights derived from our analysis. However, while doing this
project, one thing that we have to keep in mind is if there are any confounding relationships
between two variables. It is important to acknowledge this because if we do not take into
account confounding factors it can lead to an inaccurate conclusion of our data as we can
mistakenly attribute an effect to one variable when, in fact, it's being influenced by another.
By visually presenting these insights, we hope to offer valuable information to businesses,
particularly in how they can tailor their marketing strategies and product offerings to better
target and engage younger audiences.
